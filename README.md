## Overview

### Features

Users are able to:

- log in(We will assume that the accounts of residents are pre-created and there will be no sign-up feature.)

- view their reservations.
- create new reservations by selecting the amenity type, date, and time (Only logged-in users should be able to see the reservations page and create reservations if the current number of reservations does not exceed the capacity).
